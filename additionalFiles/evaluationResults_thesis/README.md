These folders contain the results from the experiments performed in the thesis.

  - "bitVector" corresponds to the results with respect to the time measure "subset" (SS)
  - "evaluation" corresponds to the results with respect to the time measure "function evaluation" (FE)
 - "normTime" corresponds to the results with respect to the time measure "normalized time" (NT)
 
 Files with the suffix "_normalized" contain the AUC-norm values, the files without that suffix contain the AUC-rel values.
